                    <h3>SolarWinds Orion</h3>
                    <div>               
                        I am reviewing a tool from SolarWinds called Orion. Orion is a network monitoring, 
                        network analysing and config managing tool. 
                        This tool is used by the network infrastructure managing team and the helpdesk at Suez Beerse. 
                        They use it to locate problems on the network. 
                        They also use it to maintain a good network and change the config of a lot of different devices at once.
                        </br> </br>
                        Before they bought this expensive tool, they used Nagios. 
                        Nagios is an open source tool that offers a log server and a network analyser. 
                        They had installed a plugin that allowed them to see their devices on a world map. 
                        This feature also exists in the Solarwinds Orion package. </br></br>
                        The problem with Nagios was, that they could not customize it enough to their liking. 
                        The dashboard was a confusing webpage with a lot of information they do not need and the information they need is really hard to see and understand. 
                        This is where Orion shines. Orion’s customisation is unlimited as long as you know how to use the tool.
                        </br></br> 
                        There are however a couple of problems with Orion. First the price. 
                        The price is really high (well I think it is a high price). They told me it was a 30,000 euros investment and I think that is a bit high for small companies trying to manage a small amount of devices. </br>
                        Next is the fact that it is overwhelming. The second you log in you are getting swallowed in a lot of data and it’s hard to find a way through the interface (might be me because I did not know a lot of the terms used). 
                        Finally there is the polling mechanism.  When you want to enter a new MIB, you have to send the MIB files to Solarwinds and they have to add it, this can take up to a week. 
                        </br></br>

                        Despite those few faults  it is a really good tool to use. There are alternatives, like Nagios, but those do not offer the customization Orion offers you. 
                        The customization is awesome and once you get to know and customized the interface, it is really easy to use and understand. You just have to give it time. 
                        The fact that you can push scripts to many devices at once is life changing and the world map this tool offers is really good. 
                        If you have the right SNMP-location set on the device, it adds it on the right location on the map. 
                        The charts this tool offers are really easy to read, create and customize. Having their own forum, the community behind this tool is active, friendly and helpful. 
                        I would recommend this tool to any major companies struggling with maintaining and analysing their network.
