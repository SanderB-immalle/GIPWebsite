                        So now you know who I am, let’s talk about what I do. I’m a student in IT & Networking at Immaculata Instutuut in Malle. <br/>
                        The reason why I’m an IT student is because I fell in love with the IT world when I was younger. I didn’t have a PlayStation to play games on, so I had to get games for my pc. It was pretty hard to find games suitable for my system because it wasn’t very good. I had to look on the backside of the box and see the recommended specs. Most of the time I had to ask my mum if she knew if our pc could run the game.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The first game I really played was GTA IV. I was around 12 years old when I first played the game and hell I played that game for over a year non-stop ! It was really fun. Right now I hear you saying things like ‘Games ? What do they have to do with IT ?’. Well, it didn’t stop after playing the game. I looked up videos on YouTube, and I mean a lot of them. I got really hooked on YouTube and started watching more and more videos.
                        <br/><br/>
                        After I had been infected with the ‘YouTube disease’ I started playing Minecraft. My friend bought a server domain and hosted a server but he had no idea what he had to do so I reached out to him and offered to help. My friend then decided I should be an Admin on his server. When I got that title I got really interested in everything I could do. I had so much power and I really liked the responsibility I had. We decided to download plugins – they give more in-depth gameplay options to players – and I was responsible to get them working. When I dug through the files and files of those plugins I saw my first real JavaScript code – back then I didn’t know it was JavaScript -. I had no idea what I was doing but I started changing values in the code and things started to happen on the server. I was so proud of what I did. I then realised, coding was my cup of tea.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The first year of high school I went to VITO in Hoogstraten. After being there for a year I realised woodwork and metal processing were not my strongest points, so I decided to go to Immaculata Instituut. The first year at Immaculata was pretty hard. I hadn’t had as in-depth French as my fellow students so I fell behind pretty quickly. My maths and pretty much every other course were horrible. I got a B- certificate and they told me I had to go to another school. I told my teachers I wanted to do ICT and I redid the 2nd grade .
                        <br/><br/>
                        I have always struggled with every course except for a course that had to do with IT. Right now, with the IT courses gaining more importance I’m getting better grades. With being one of the best, I just want to go back to my teachers in the 2nd grade and tell them: “Look at me now”.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the past summer vacation I worked for Sita Suez. It was my first job. I had to help the IT department. Day in and day out I had to install Windows 10 on computers, it got boring so fast. Before I had this job I thought fixing computers was fun but I realised it was different really fast. Right now I’m dedicated to go to college to study Software development because I’m pretty good at it and I do really enjoy breaking my brain over some code. I wish I could use my coding abilities in other courses but I’m afraid that I haven’t found a way yet.
